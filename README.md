# Civic-Sparks_testing
web project 
Our solution Civic Portal. It has two parts: 
A Citizen App/Web – where people can report an issue with a photo, location, audio, video, 
or description. They can also track what’s happening with their complaint. 
An Authority Dashboard – where officials can see all issues on a map, assign work to staff, 
and check complaint trends. 
We have built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Supabase as the 
backend.
